# BindingState Module Overview

Binding state implementations store the state-side metadata needed by binding
nodes.

- `BindingState.ts`: Base class providing common state accessor helpers.
- `BindingStateIndex.ts`: Manages list index tracking for repeat bindings.
- `types.ts`: Interfaces describing binding state objects and factories.
