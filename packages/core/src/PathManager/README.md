# PathManager Module Overview

Path manager utilities keep track of state property paths and dynamic
dependencies for bindings.

- `PathManager.ts`: Implements lookup, registration, and dependency tracking for
  property paths across bindings.
- `types.ts`: Type declarations describing path entries, dependency graphs, and
  related helpers.
